# Basic Network Design & Configuration with GNS3
## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic network design and configuration using Cisco IOSv in GNS3. The setup includes configuring IP addressing, static routing, VLANs, and Inter-VLAN routing in a simulated environment. This will help us understand and implement fundamental networking concepts using GNS3 in a Virtualized Environment.
## Objectives
- Design and configure a small network topology with 3 routers and 2 switches.
- Implement basic IP addressing and subnetting.
- Set up static routing between routers.
- Configure VLANs and perform Inter-VLAN routing on switches.
## Utilities used
- GNS3
- HyperV (For GNS3-VM)
- Cisco IOSv
- PuTTY
