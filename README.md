# Basic Network Design & Configuration with GNS3
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic network design and configuration using Cisco IOSv in GNS3. The setup includes configuring IP addressing, static routing, VLANs, and Inter-VLAN routing in a simulated environment. This will help us understand and implement fundamental networking concepts using GNS3 in a Virtualized Environment.
